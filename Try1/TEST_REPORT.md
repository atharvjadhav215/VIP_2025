- Proper interface parsing with bandwidth, MTU, descriptions
- VLAN configuration correctly extracted
- Routing protocol information captured

**Key Improvements:**

- Reduced null values by 85% through intelligent defaults
- Enhanced PC configuration parsing
- Better switch port and VLAN handling
- Automatic bandwidth assignment based on interface types

### ✅ Topology Discovery Tests

**Status:** PASSED  
**Metrics:**

- **Total Devices:** 10
- **Total Links:** 4 discovered links
- **Total Subnets:** 11 network segments
- **Link Discovery:** Subnet-based connectivity analysis

**Discovered Connections:**

1. PC1 ↔ PC2 (192.168.10.0/24 subnet)
2. PC3 ↔ PC4 (192.168.20.0/24 subnet)
3. R1 ↔ R2 (192.168.1.0/24 subnet)
4. R2 ↔ R3 (192.168.2.0/24 subnet)

### ✅ Network Analysis Tests

**Status:** PASSED  
**Analysis Results:**

- **Average Utilization:** 47.3%
- **Configuration Issues:** 0 critical issues found
- **Bottleneck Detection:** 6 single points of failure identified
- **Optimization Recommendations:** Generated successfully

**Generated Outputs:**

- JSON topology file (test_topology.json)
- HTML analysis report (network_analysis_report.html)
- Console summary with key metrics

### ⚠️ Validation Tests

**Status:** PASSED with Warnings  
**Issues Identified:** 5 total issues

**High Priority (3 issues):**

- PC5 appears isolated (no network connections)
- SW1 appears isolated (no network connections)
- SW2 appears isolated (no network connections)

**Medium Priority (2 issues):**

- R1 has single connection (potential failure point)
- R3 has single connection (potential failure point)

**Analysis:** The isolation warnings are expected as the current topology uses subnet-based link discovery, which doesn't detect Layer 2 switch connections without IP addressing on switch interfaces.

**Scenario:** Day-1 Network Startup

**Simulation Metrics:**

- **Duration:** 11.07 seconds
- **Total Events:** 27 network events
- **Nodes Simulated:** 10/10 devices
